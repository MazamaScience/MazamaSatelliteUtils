The _MazamaSatelliteUtils_ R package is intended to facilitate working with GOES 16 and 17 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data provided by NOAA and available through [The U.S. Forest Service AirFire Research Team](airfire.org) data site.  The package is designed to allow easy access to AOD data and provides a host of features to analyze and visualize the data.

Intended users of this package are researchers of wildfire smoke or anyone interested in studying the effects of aerosols in the atmosphere.  It is released under GPL and is available from [Github](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaSatelliteUtils).

_MazamaSatelliteUtils_ requires that the R programming language be installed, as well as the following R packages.

* _sp_ 
* _MazamaSpatialUtils_

These, and the _MazamaSatelliteUtils_ package itself, can be installed from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). 

```install.packages('MazamaSatelliteUtils')```.

Developers and people interested in working with the very latest version of the code can install it directly from Github. 

```devtools::install_github('mazamascience/MazamaSatelliteUtils')```.


## Introduction to GOES AOD Data

### GOES 16 & 17

The _MazamaSatelliteUtils_ package uses data provided by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16 and 17.  GOES 16 and 17 are also known as "GOES-East" and "GOES-West" respectively due to the difference in their positioning relative to the surface of the Earth.   GOES-16 (East) is positioned over the Equator at a geographic longitude roughly equal to Dover, DE and is intended to provide good imaging of the Eastern half of the United States.  GOES-17 (West) is also positioned over the Equator, roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Honolulu, and is intended to cover the Western half of the U.S..

The ABI imager on the GOES satellites operate in a variety of scanning modes which capture data at different intervals.  The AOD data used by _MazamaSatelliteUtils_ is obtained by scanning the full extent of the Contiguous U.S. (CONUS) every five minutes.  Other data sets produced by the GOES satellites, include:

* Cloud and Moisture Imagery 
* Fire/Hot Spot Characterization
* Land Surface Temperature
* Rainfall Rate
* Sea Surface Temperature
* Snow Cover

### AOD

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the number of particles (aerosols) in the air.  It indicates the level at which they prevent light from traveling through the atmosphere. Aerosols scatter and absorb incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility.  From an observer on the ground, a low AOD indicates “clean” air - characteristic of clear blue sky, bright sun and maximum visibility.  When AOD increases, aerosols can become so dense that the sun is obscured.  

### DQF 

In addition to AOD, _MazamaSatelliteUtils_ uses the Data Quality Flag (DQF) to provide the user with an indication of AOD data quality.  The DQF is a separate variable associated with each AOD data point and has 4 possible quality levels - 0, 1, 2, and 3.  These values correspond with _no-retrieval, low, medium and high quality_ AOD data.

DQF is affected by numerous factors, but a few of the most significant are:
* Sun angle
* Satellite zenith angle
* Bright land surface (presence of snow, ice or sand)
* Clouds

Several of these factors vary by season (clouds and snow) and by time of day (sun angle) but the satellite zenith angle is a geographic effect that cannot be altered.  Depending on where in the Contiguous United States an AOD point is located, it may be impossible to obtain a high-quality DQF value.  This is illustrated in the [GOES-East Data Quality Spatial Limits](goes-east_data_quality_limits.html) document.
