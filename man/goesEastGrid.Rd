\format{A list with three elements}
\description{
This dataset is the latitude/longitude grid that GOES-16 ABI data is defined
on, computed from ABI scan angles provided in the netCDF and the projection
parameters found in \code{goesEastGrid$projection}. Because GOES-16 is a
geostationary satellite, the projection information should not change from
scan to scan. Using this dataset saves us from repeating the computationally
expensive task of converting scan angles to latitude/longitude.
