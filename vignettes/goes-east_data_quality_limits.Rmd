## Western Exclusion

Aerosol optical depth readings from the GOES-East satellite are each labeled
with a data quality flag ranging from 0 to 2 (high to low) including an 
additional flag, 3, for "no retrieval flag". Plotting data with no quality 
restrictions typically results in an image similar to the following:

While clouds and snow might leave many regions obscured or spotty, we can see 
that there is at least some coverage for the whole continental United States. 
However, when plotting *just* medium and/or high quality data we notice 
something interesting:

As expected, a lot points have been removed from the map--leaving many regions 
much more bare than before. What is strange though is the culling of the entire 
West Coast: There isn't a single point left in Washington, Oregon, or
Idaho, and large parts of California, Nevada, and Montana are completely blank. 
This excluded region seems to be cut off by a fairly well-defined curve which 
arcs through North Dakota down towards southern California. Higher quality data
only exists within this boundary that contains the eastern half of the country.

So what is this boundary and why does it exist? 

## Satellite Angle Limitations

Due to GOES-East's geostationary orbit over the equator at 75.0W, the 
satellite's ABI scanner is limited to only covering the area shown below:

The satellite has a clear view of the regions directly below it, but due to the
curvature of the Earth, the further the scanner looks out the more distorted its
view becomes. Southeastern states like Florida can be scanned almost 
straight-on, but those on the opposite coast like Washington, Oregon, and 
California can only be seen at a very shallow angle.

Part of what separates low quality readings from the rest are the local and 
solar zenith angles (LZA/SZA) of the observation points. The 
[GOES-R documentation](https://www.goes-r.gov/products/docs/PUG-L2+-vol5.pdf) 
defines each of these on page 36:

* Local zenith angle: The angle between the line of sight to the satellite and 
the zenith at the observation target. (Viewing zenith angle in the diagram)

* Solar zenith angle: The angle between the line of sight to the sun and the 
zenith at the observation target.

The documentation states that: "There are many ABI Level 2+ products where the 
[LZA/SZA] has an adverse effect on the quality of product data or precludes its 
generation". For the aerosol optical depth product, zenith angle limits are 
set which determine "good" and "degraded" data.
